# Sampling from the Matrix von Mises-Fisher Distribution

This repository implements the rejection sampling scheme for matrix von Mises-Fisher distribution proposed in the paper ["Simulation of the Matrix Bingham–von Mises–Fisher Distribution, With Applications to Multivariate and Relational Data"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07177) by Peter D. Hoff. 

## Background



See very nice [figures](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Bayesian-Inference-with-the-von-Mises-Fisher-in-3-D-Straub/26d5bb31153df418388b6eb242b2d8842c039c2d#extracted) visualizing the distribution on 2D circle and 3D sphere.

## Usage

`pip install geomstats`
 
`python3 main.py`
